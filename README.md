-Weather App for who wants to check the weather.

-TASK FOR MYSELF IN THIS PROJECT: Build a site that people can search for a location and see all the infos about the weather like degree, windspeed and humidity. 

-What was the best practices for me in this project: I have used React Hooks such as useState and useEffect also I have used useContext for practice. Also I have fetch the weathers live data from an API. I’ve used axios library for fetching the data.
